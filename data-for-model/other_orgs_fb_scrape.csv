Over the next 24 hours, we want to see as many... people as possible raise awareness about human trafficking through sharing Petya’s story by hosting a Facebook Watch Party. When you host a watch party, you are not only raising awareness, but you are inviting your friends to make a difference with you. And this Giving Tuesday, we're excited to share that all donations given through our website will be DOUBLED up to $130,000!

One that doesn’t cost you a cent today, but can make a world of difference to a survivor a day in the future. The Safe Night App gives you the opportunity to provide a hotel night for a survivor when shelter is not immediately available.  You sign up today and designate the organization you want to support.  Then only when a temporary hotel stay is needed, you receive an alert for the ...amount of that hotel stay.   If you are able to help, you put in your payment info, the request is closed, the survivor is safely sheltered for another night.  Designated funds specifically for that survivor’s immediate need.  California Against Slavery partners with multiple agencies/organizations in helping to fund these temporary stays.  Just recently we received a call for help to fund a short stay for a survivor as she was being assessed for acceptance into a local shelter.  The shelter staff provides care. We were able to help provide temporary shelter. With your help, we can do more!  CAS is looking for 50 Safe Night App donors. Please join us because everyone deserves a violence free night.  Grateful to partner with you, Ginger Shaw, Executive Director We welcome guest submissions.

"77",3939108949482088,"Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW)",3,8,0,0,0,4,2,0,14,2,"We're deeply saddened by the tragedy in Atlanta this week. And we see the deep connections to the intersections of misogyny and racism AAPI women face daily, including sexualization, objectification, exoticization and fetishization, which this NY Times article highlights (and an incredible panelist on our At the Edge of the Margins virtual round table on the role of the media in normalizing prostitution spotlighted as well https://bit.ly/2NER06s). It was #femicide of mostly A...sian women and women of Asian descent by a white man who viewed them as sexual objects who ""tempted"" him.  While the facts are still becoming clear, there is evidence presenting itself to show how the sex trade system played a part and we need to talk about that too. Reports have been surfacing that signal this man was a sex buyer who had sought to purchase prostitution at ""massage parlors,"" including at two of the establishments he later targeted. Let's remember that men who purchase prostitution feed the sex trade and fuel sex trafficking. They are an essential pillar of the sex trade system. There are also indications that he was a consumer of porn, which, as we've discussed many times, normalizes violence against women and trades in racialized and sexualized objectification of women.  And there's more. This The Boston Globe column looks at how women in illicit ""massage parlors"" are viewed by those who seek to purchase them: https://bit.ly/3f55VBU. ""Prostitution is an industry that markets and brands Asian women. It has a real investment in cheapening racism and increasing sexism,"" Suzanne Jay of Asian Women for Equality said in a recent interview that also highlighted how ""Asian women are over-represented in prostitution, particularly in storefront establishments like massage parlours."" In a press release (https://bit.ly/3lEsFdp), we urge the City of #Atlanta to look into potential #sextrafficking and prostitution at these establishments and the sex trade connections we highlight as it investigates this tragedy and hate crime against women of color. Those killed deserve justice. And AAPI women deserve more than to be sexualized, objectified, exoticized and fetishized — racist, misogynist ideas the sex trade system promotes and on which it capitalizes.","2021-03-19T22:07:42","","https://external.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQG-bE4f1nr5uXWL&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic01.nyt.com%2Fimages%2F2021%2F03%2F18%2Fus%2F18asian-women%2Fmerlin_185207874_b3aafd1f-ffdd-40d4-9894-3ac2ffd2ea77-facebookJumbo.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&ccb=3-4&_nc_hash=AQGpX-Hn4g9UVtqB","https://www.facebook.com/CATWIntl/posts/3939108949482088?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBzQO4TVZsHIWF5PplNqJ1eP_WHGreFBC4DPBajYwUKrr3JT-3arQuuc_L0Ii2cwi70E1KhBMKkhUUcuKXHvazMBY2rtPHOibPbnAjMxoybgskg1468B6CSIEzcr-TsfNjbKupmbF60kOgirkL6tApc43Fi1kUFl0QxYTb4V4r0-U1KkvlJHnzJNtkr8Q99y618bvdUzUC80OaE7D3esw3zY0DHWZ4OlytGLnvALMzSRbVCT1aSFrhBynRb5APuhFljT9nx7T5HQbEroomOG6iIfqy41LSCsUdDHl7kEuJz5M9zC6jzxg&__tn__=-R"

I have always had a heart for women and children and particularly towar...ds those who find themselves suffering and in need. I served in a volunteer capacity as Executive Director for Birthright of Cedar Rapids from 1987-1997. In 2001 we helped start The House of Hope where we housed and helped woman who had experienced horrific trauma in many cases. As Executive Director there, I helped develop the curriculum and program that involved whole health and healing; body, soul, spirit. While serving there, I began to receive calls from people around the country with stories of women and children who had been victimized by the heinous crime and evil of human sex trafficking. In 2013 we started Cedar Rapids Gives which would later turn into Chains Interrupted. In an interview recently, someone asked me why I continue to do what I do. (They asked me because Bob and are at retirement age)  My answer, simply, “Because I can not not do it”.","2021-03-11T18:00:10",NA,"https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/159283051_1190417591406021_263009638808844500_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=PZ6PaCySSbQAX_lgLAN&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=d97ee55579139eec48be77a33a7ff4d6&oe=607E197E","https://www.facebook.com/ChainsInterrupted/photos/a.171608166620307/1190417588072688/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3DC5oyih3Yaj_pv-zGUJPq6ScgsZg_TNv8FMiamWQErpNGyvdocrbMokDJKyJo__iebvAE2-2KsHHKb_VF8ixEPtfAVBjuOt7vsil0_92dLB5V5pubJNgZtC6jE0CK-O1TDbubrUSNbQqJscK5aI1vCoCyyCIvqmkRhrkc7aARP6u_obGAMpxmXt-lRA-a2VyF6_52ZYaS0MNvPoQfvdWr9o_uKO3kvmOz8J_wdLK6yQcQ0BSbtcSqvFebxlQIWsHCFZ1MVMupirnF-DHi31P768iZRgS1qkBiYf2RPF0692cEG6snA&__tn__=-R"

So, I have been helping ever since!” What do you do with CI? “I take in donations and sell them on FB, our annual garage sale in Center Point, Stuff Etc and Elegant Repeats. Plus volunteer at your different events!” What most surprised you about human trafficking?  “The fact that you almost have to know someone who is doing this horrible act because of the sheer volume. Also, the youngest victim in IA (18 months)!!!” What would you like people to know about trafficking?  “With this Covid right now the numbers are increasing significantly!” Is there anything people might be surprised to know about you that you would like to share?

One minute she was the property of someone and then in a ninety-second raid, she was freed. I was there, taking her hand as my team secured the area. We moved as one and extracted three tiny broken vessels and in a moment we were gone, taking them to a new home, a new life.  I am speaking... to those who are rescuers and to those who will answer the call.  The business that we are in, that of rescuing humans from the tyranny of enslavement, is one with a myriad of enemies. There are human elements who want nothing more than to stop us, hurt us, or destroy us. We are stealing their products, livelihood, and futures.  Right now as you read this, countless children are being abused in every way invented. Just like the 90-year-old slave woman I rescued who dreamed everyday of freedom, there are multitudes of children dreaming the same dream. Forty million people around the globe are dreaming this dream. We are warriors of a righteous cause, men and women who must rise to the level of excellence to storm the dark arenas of evil. Once this mission is anchored in your heart, there is no turning back. However, the cause of abolition comes with a price; that of ceasing to live for self and sacrificing the comforts and security of safe living.  You must deny your own self dreams to become a rescuer of those who dream of being free.  It is incomprehensible to healthy-minded humans to realize that countless men and woman have descended into the darkness of harming children, of using them, of destroying them. Those of us who value a moral code and a champion’s heart can do nothing but fight for the helpless victims of malevolent-hearted humans. These predators value their own perverted pleasure over a child’s welfare, and in many cases, the child’s very life.  I give an invitation for champions to rise up, to deny self and live as warriors of the forgotten children of sex trafficking and labor slavery. As you read this, countless tears are falling from innocent eyes, hope for freedom is being crushed under a pervert’s control, and children are fading away without anyone ever knowing their names.  Who will save the children?  Will it be you?

Irena worked with ten others in an underground network that she established in Poland during World War II. Some of the methods used to smuggle Jewish children included using an ambulance and hiding children under the stretcher, or if quite young, utilizing a trolley to transport children hidden in sacks or suitcases. Irena and her team also used the ghetto’s sewer pipes as an underground passage to the ...outside. Through these methods, Irena and her supporters rescued 2,500 children. We celebrate Irena Sendler this March in honor of Women’s History Month.  Irena Sendler is the perfect inspiration for us today as we face an estimated 40.3 million people in modern slavery.

Early last week, four precious girls were rescued out of the evils of forced labor and sex slavery and brought into a new life of freedom! They were severely malnourished, had been abused daily, and were forced to work long exhausting days in a brick kiln run by brutal slave masters. The parents of the two eldest girls died three years ago. The 7-year-old twins had lost their mother, and their father became mentally unstable. Consequently, these young orphans were... enslaved in hard labor for the rest of their lives to pay off the debts of their parents. Today, however, these precious little girls are now free! They will never again make bricks in the scorching desert heat, endure continuous abuse, or be trapped in the darkness of slavery. Now these young girls live in a very loving home (with other previously rescued girls, some of whom are in the photos) where they receive medical care, nutritious food, new clothing, an education and a lot of nurturing care. They are now on the journey of healing and growth and have hope for a bright future in freedom.","2021-03-09T15:43:23","","https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p168x128/159146559_10157943895752828_3160768826462056098_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=tTShH5iZmeMAX9mrSIM&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=e599fc85e8193f2770c485a0519a7842&oe=607CAD28 https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/158970556_10157943896747828_967597561664821874_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=3Pi2nZxFlHoAX9m0ov9&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=ed78ae859769ca470d00a77aa03f349d&oe=607E960F https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p168x128/159040562_10157943898362828_6087182735691723872_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=twK0qVzPxRAAX-7SBx1&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=7b0c4b5713c76e0d2dd991b3d6e46370&oe=607C8062","https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensRescueInitiative/posts/10157943922732828?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAlRpARxzyiRfMFiXBy5zYFxlY56OWb-j5EYQz3dIhNNq-ewEv2kvlW-Q_KMF1RZYokP7MQtm-378iTOgfWXYbclHqzBrSuEa9ZWd5EBp1MeR6cxgenZ2OWapgIbgTQKaKnpsyLrr9zUZb4LBkEPUzVw5nqtZttc4A76wGJUj1upy6vCO11n8W_2cZZIywFj6hM4yp30AZRaEez0Tri4WaPgqfbXp_v-z-CSs_iO37j_ZuHYilkDstwVu8qBJLpRycoJ7M-HTXlL_oDzB3TwgevjGo4ARjkXMA-vfHg-4rTTrd390J-&__tn__=-R"

Not only do we have many women working within our organization but we've had many women join us in our TEAMS and Medical training.  With over 40 million people enslaved in our world we are keenly aware that we cannot fight this battle alone. Rescue missions require many volunteers -- rescue operators who are our boots on the ground, medics, and overseers of aftercare. There... are many working tirelessly ""behind the scenes"" stateside as well. Many of these volunteers are women. And we thank all of you for your efforts and time. We could not do this without you.  We are specifically looking for women to come join our trainings this year as we believe that women participating in children's rescues is imperative.

We’d like to observe women from our past and present, from all over the world, who have made a lasting difference in the lives of children. Many Indian girls during the late 1800’s were dedicated to the gods, and were required to live with the temple priests who forced the children into prostitution for profit. When Amy arri...ved in India and heard about these atrocities, she was determined to whatever she could to rescue these children. Amy would dye her skin with coffee and dress in Hindu clothing in order to sneak into the temples and take the children! Amy rescued hundreds of children this way. The first child she took into her home was a seven-year-old girl named Preena. Amy overcame gender prejudice, health limitations, and her own personal fears in order to rescue these children.

He started having severe bouts of sadness. These episodes started lasting hours, and they came coupled with memories of when he was a young 8-year-old boy and was abused. He had decided to fight the memories, but that wasn't working only making things worse. He knew he needed to do something about it, so he searched for an outlet to express what had happened to him. He started using... open mics as a way of sharing his story to encourage others but the audience there was not right for his platform and he would at times get harassed. He thought he couldn’t take one more night, but knew the best option was to keep going. He started getting creative with how he told his story and it was catching people’s attention. And with this, he knew he was on to something. Jeremy has now been speaking out in public for two years. He, like us, believes that we must bring more attention to this subject, which is essential if we stand any chance of breaking the stigma and the silence.

It's a cause that many people feel strongly about, particularly when it involves children.  But taking matters into your own hands as a civilian is not the answer.  Law enforcement are the only entity who can legally hold human traffickers accountable, and DeliverFund works within legal parameters and directly with our law enforcement partners.  Vigilantism is often dangerous and illegal, and more importantly, it can make problems worse for victims. Please bear in mind that searching out and sharing child sexual abuse material, no matter your intentions, is illegal and makes you complicit in the continued exploitation of victims. It also boosts the platform's algorithms, which assists the predators in finding like-minded people to trade images.

Be warned, this subject matter is not for the faint of heart, and this one should not be played around kids. As an Operative who served as a Country Chief for a Special Unit within the CIA, Nic witnessed not only the epidemic of child trafficking within illicit markets but also the unrealized opportunity to apply his understanding and training to influence this global crisis. When Nic began to work with experts to b...etter understand the problem in the United States he found it impossible to turn a blind eye. As a result, DeliverFund was officially established as a 501c3 in October 2014 as a counter-human trafficking organization, focused on ending sex slavery in the United States. Nic spent 11 years in US Special Operations as an Air Force Pararescueman prior to being recruited to the Central Intelligence Agency. Due to his highly specialized training and experience in both special and intelligence operations, Nic has a firm understanding of these illicit, illegal markets and has the highest levels of training to effectively combat them.""

The European Commission, Council of the European Union, a...nd the European Parliament need to meet and agree on a temporary suspension of the part of the law that prohibits scanning. ⁠ ⁠ Unbelievably, this is being opposed by Birgit Sippel, who's representing the Parliament in the discussions. She's insisting on changes which cannot be met within any reasonable timeframe, arguing the scanning tools are a threat to privacy.⁠ ⁠ ‼️But let's set things straight.‼️ Privacy laws were never meant to make it difficult to locate and delete pictures of a child being sexually abused. They were not meant to make it easier for an offender grooming a child for sexual purposes. And the tools that are being used pose NO threat at all to anybody’s privacy.⁠ ⁠ So please, Birgit Sippel! You can change this, and that's why we're asking you to agree to the temporary suspension.

I know my rights, how child trafficking operates, the sign...s young girls should watch out for,” says one student. “I want to bring girls who have been exploited out of the darkness and make them aware of the legal options available to them.”⁠ ⁠ Sherpa was raped by a neighbour at 11 years old. At the age of 15-17, she was sexually exploited at the dance bar she worked for to pay for her mother’s medical treatment. Last summer, at the age of 20, she joined the School for Justice in Kathmandu.⁠ “Since I have enrolled in the law course I don’t feel like the same person anymore — from being a poor student in school to being diagnosed with depression, I have finally learned to focus, to have a goal. I can speak confidently in front of people,” she says.⁠ Another student, Khatun, was trafficked by a man she met in college, who sexually exploited her at a brothel for two months. When she managed to get away to meet her family, she also reported the crime. No one was arrested and she didn’t get the justice she was looking for.⁠ “It took me years to get my life together. But the man who raped me roams free. Back then, I did not know how to protect myself and what my rights were after being raped. Now I want to make sure it doesn’t happen to other girls.” ⁠✊⁠ Children and survivors are at the centre of the ECPAT member's work. We’re proud to see the results of their important work — how it empowers survivors of sexual exploitation them in a way that brings their lived experience at the centre of driving change.⁠ ⁠ Read full article: https://www.aljazeera.com/…/the-child-trafficking-survivors… 📷 Free a Girl through Al Jazeera English","2021-01-12T11:09:25","","","https://www.facebook.com/ecpat/posts/10160166479390348?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAbqgS-m5jTIksOK9qOHY_WgxIm4VrTLRq7ne_8qAwjzoD8Yfja4C984Er87i2PgX1eOFqKWkMQ0yf-cNid1kRZIw0B1-TTJXtW8_ueB7qzaWJtu6bBeEshy6NYuGTw5C9uisJln-Yhl5vxtupLuCClCdjYU_Er_zI2v_1_3RrOluI8_DbUbeKPJyC5Ww9y8tf-5MfrLF8-t5jhSUr1sSbttFcqrLeyKEuGvV_WQ0OEXXhjjBA_I1zsgDqQya02dzHFDQm8e02fLpONp6-TSKvouZwJvmlVq0lGHX3UwGRKSTvhMShy&__tn__=-R"

COVID transmission, all schools have closed down again for the next 2 week period. Gatherings of over 20 people are prohibited and the Ministry of Health has instructed people to wear masks and practice social distancing.  Hagar’s services and programs in Cambodia continue to be implemented as normal, however, staff are observing the continual impacts of COVID in the lives of clients and their families.  There is evidence that domestic violence and rates of child sexual abuse have been increasing in Cambodia. COVID has also had a significant impact on the nation’s economy with our staff on the ground reporting that 50% of the businesses run by families we work with are experiencing lower incomes. There are fewer job opportunities in communities, and with the Thailand border closed there are limited options for gaining employment elsewhere. Our staff are concerned about the vulnerability this creates and the potential for illegal migration across the Thailand border and/or the falsehoods traffickers could tell people about their ability to get people across safely and into jobs.  Hagar continues to work closely with clients and their families during this tough time and supports them as much as possible with food assistance, counseling and help finding employment.

"335",10157158949176362,"Hagar International",1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,"We are excited to share with you some updates from the ground today.  Because of you, our supporters, we can make Reality Check: Finding Hope a reality for so many! In Afghanistan, Christmas is not celebrated by the general population. However, expats working in different organizations sometimes have parties inside their offices to celebrate.  The latest numbers from Afghanistan report a total of 49,273 cases of COVID, with 38,384 recoveries and 1971 deaths. Afghanistan has also experienced a significant economic decline as a result of the pandemic due to reduced activity and trade disruption. Such a decline has put financial pressure on many, including current and former Hagar clients. Hagar continues to provide assistance where possible in finding work and has experienced meaningful success.  For example, some of the women participating in Hagar’s women’s project had been struggling to provide food for their families. In addition to providing counseling sessions, Hagar’s team introduced some clients to factories and now several are working sewing masks and medical clothes and have a source of income.  In addition to providing help finding employment, Hagar Afghanistan also distributes emergency funds to help those who are desperate to cover basic expenses.  Given the economic slowdown, a second wave of the pandemic, continued conflict, and an uncertain peace process and political environment, the country will continue to need grant support from the international community to address its fiscal deficit and maintain its current provision of basic services.  Overall however, Hagar Afghanistan’s activities are almost back to normal. Recently, one of the women in Hagar Afghanistan’s women’s project expressed to Hagar staff that she wanted to start a tailoring course in the basement of her house and teach women to sew as a way of trying to improve her poor financial situation. However, she needed help buying the equipment she needed to get herself started.

But then with the support of one of Hope for Justice’s community development workers..., Aberash joined one of our Self-Help Groups, which empower women through parenting and child protection, anti-trafficking and exploitation, communication and a range of other skills.    At first, Aberash lacked confidence. But through the group sessions, she learned life-changing lessons about how to form working relationships, identifying needs, saving money, and other skills vital for running a small business.    Aberash benefitted from the Self-Help Group loan system, which helps women become more financially stable. The loans allowed her to begin selling a local soft drink, and then cabbages too. She then bought a cart to help her husband with his work. Another loan, plus the profits from her business, meant she was able to buy some land upon which she is now building a home.  Thanking Hope for Justice for its support over four years, Aberash said: “I was in the dark waiting for people’s support, but Hope for Justice opened my eyes and now not only I am economically strong, but also respected in my community.”  Aberash is now paying back her loans and is looking forward to expanding her business. She also wants to help other women in a similar situation as she once was.    Through education and sensitisation to child protection issues, family strengthening via Hope for Justice’s Self-Help Group model enables greater support for those most at risk of exploitation and trafficking. The model is a long-term, sustainable solution, directed by community members’ own efforts. This approach protects against family breakdown, a major risk factor in child trafficking.","2021-03-21T12:45:01","","","https://www.facebook.com/hopeforjustice/posts/10158181442008282?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDbV9siqYw0E2Sf9C-bHflpDLJDwVJRSZofWg9yGkuIcdr2FGAQ8X8DS8bIkUiiFVv3E_re0I-8jSHiLTm6Ik_4PPaK9FGIHJ_0deOpgniPXxHewCHbVy0tgB7ARUHxP8ca6bg-zYz_IUfJGDZfDZLYiPrfloLKEmucgQqOMkHLcpOWhyGIk9LpArkkEcBOiC6wk6XUUxEQEmFttjL-xF2ZMoMVzxnCTqLNCY3Gi8p3czNcfPUWZxMqZXNZYZENlIua0oPPt454FfyPKSTe6AdAZyVVdwkYN4BXPno_uHyzBn6K0WE_&__tn__=-R"

Thanks to the newly established Stepping Stone Project, many of the older girls are also equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to make their way... in the world. For many of the survivors we care for, it’s not possible for them to return to their families, often because it was their own family who trafficked them, or because the stigma they would face in the community where they grew up would not be possible to overcome.

Our life skills sessions cover everything from making safe choices and decisions to managing money. We equip the young people with the knowledge and awareness they need to care for their physical and mental health, as well as developing their everyday skills such as cooking and looking after their own home.

Lighthouses provide temporary, safe accommodation for survivors of human trafficking and children who had been intensely vulnerable to trafficking. In these safe places, they benefit from trauma-informed aftercare, catch-up education and vocational skills training.  The children in our care range in age from toddlers to teenagers. Uganda has one of th...e youngest populations in the world – 56% of its citizens are under 18 years old. Sadly, over half of this child population are deemed critically or moderately vulnerable.  Out of every 100 children, 11 are orphans.  Keeping children safe here can be challenging. The UN Population Fund reports that 60% of adolescents aged 10-19 years have experienced physical violence, 42% emotional violence and 10% sexual violence. Many of these children also experience homelessness. Living on the streets increases the risk of violence, trafficking and exploitation as they struggle for their basic needs.  Working with local law enforcement, Hope for Justice takes in hundreds of vulnerable children each month and reunites them with their family or into loving family-based care when it's possible and safe to do so.

The FBI has seen a huge increase in the number of children and teens being threatened and coerced by adults into sending explicit images online -- a crime called sextortion. These child sexual abuse materials are due to online predators luring young men and women through sextin...g.  Parents must monitor their child's online usage, and talk with their children  about the dangers of chatting with strangers online and sending explicit photos of themselves, says Innocents at Risk Founder Deborah Sigmund.

One of the FBI agents who was fatally wounded had recently spoken to middle school students about cyber safety and fighting crimes against children.

Over the last 10 years, circulation of child sexual abuse materials online has grown exponentially from 600,000 images and vid...eos reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2008, to nearly 70 million such images in 2019. The current law, the Communications Decency Act of 1996, gives near carte blanche immunity to tech companies for facilitating child sexual abuse materials online because they are not considered “publishers.”  The EARN IT Act S 3398/HR 8454, which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer and awaits Senate passage, would revoke that immunity from liability by requiring tech companies to help law enforcement access critical information to remove such images. Survivors and state attorneys general would be able to sue tech companies for facilitating child sexual abuse materials online using federal civil law, and state civil and criminal laws. The proposed legislation also would create an Online Child Exploitation Prevention Commission to make recommendations to inform public policy, courts and the law enforcement community about protecting children in the ever-changing digital environment. ""Tech companies are in a position to, if the see something, say something,"" says Deborah Sigmund, founder of Innocents at Risk. ""This bill is about creating a safe environment on the Internet and keeping children safe,"" she adds. Passage of the bill before year’s end would “push technology companies to proactively clean up their own platforms to prevent sex trafficking, grooming and predatory behavior,” Sigmund says. “If tech companies act responsibly and no longer turn a blind eye to child sexual material on their websites, they will be joining the fight to end child trafficking and sexploitation,” she says.

The Zoom webinar featured anti-trafficking organizations, members of Congress and the Administration, advocates against child exploitation, national and international dignitaries, and other human rights leaders dedicated to fighting the world’s fastest growing criminal industry. Deborah Sigmund spoke of the Flight Attendant Initiative she launched in 2008 to train flight attendants to spot and report human trafficking on planes and in airports. The initiative has saved thousands of lives. Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) praised Ms. Sigmund’s “tenacious commitment to empower others to recognize and effectuate rescue of victims in transit.” Transportation Department Secretary Elaine Chao reported that over 500 executives have now signed her Transportation Leaders Against Human Trafficking Pledge. Leaders from “every mode of transportation, labor and non-governmental organizations from across the country” have agreed to train 1.3 million employees to raise awareness to fight human trafficking. Secretary Chao said “that’s an army of people” that will help law enforcement “fight the battle.” The Voices Against Trafficking webinar, which was watched by over 6,000 people around the world, can be viewed on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sfHbzhhO_A or on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/VoicesAgainstTrafficking/videos/3046436072130554 * An important piece of legislation, “Sami’s Law,” was passed by the House of Representatives on July 29, and is now awaiting action by the Senate. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith, is named in honor of Samantha “Sami” Josephson, a senior at the University of South Carolina, who was kidnapped and murdered last year by a predator pretending to be an Uber driver. The bipartisan bill, approved in a unanimous voice vote, will require ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, to deploy a verifiable electronic access system to match drivers with passengers before the ride begins, to penhance the safety of the ride-hailing public. Smith also authored the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, the first comprehensive anti-human trafficking law. *July 30 was the UN’s World Day Against Trafficking in Persons.

President Trump told the meeting of cabinet secretaries, state officials, members of Congress, nonprofit groups and survivors that an estimated 25 million people around the world today are held captive, manipulated, and abused by human traffickers. In 2018, the National Human Trafficking Hotline identified over 23,000 human trafficking vi...ctims in the U.S.; 65 percent of the victims were women and more than 20 percent were children. At the summit, President signed an executive order targeting human trafficking and child exploitation. The order expands prevention education programs, promotes housing opportunities for survivors, promotes information gathering between law enforcement and federal agencies charged with combating trafficking, and prioritizes the removal of child sexual abuse material from the Internet. The measure also designates a full-time position at the White House dedicated to combating human trafficking.

"415",3466659960037472,"Innocents at Risk",3,7,0,3,0,1,0,0,11,0,"Three victims of sex trafficking have sued Hilton Worldwide, Choice Hotels International, and Wyndham Hotels, claiming the hotel chains exercised gross negligence of on-site prostitution at their Houston-area hotel branches and don’t do enough to stop sex trafficking, according to an article in the Houston Chronicle.  That’s despite the hotel chains’ publicly stated corporate policies that promote social responsibility, the Chronicle noted in a Dec. 31 story. Two of the women... were teenagers and one an adult when trafficked in the Houston hotels. The three separate lawsuits accuse the national hotel chains of negligence and violations of federal and state laws prohibiting human trafficking. The suits claim “traffickers have long capitalized on the hotel industry’s refusal to adopt companywide anti-trafficking policies, refusal to train staff on what to look for and how to respond, and failure to establish a safe and secure reporting mechanism, and they have exploited the seclusion and privacy of hotel rooms.”  Annie McAdams, the plaintiffs’ lawyer who’s partnering with other firms on the suits, told the Houston Chronicle that these cases are the first such effort targeted at parent company hotel chains. The parent companies claim they’re not responsible for what happens at their hotel locations, McAdams told the Chronicle. A spokesperson for Hilton Americas told the Chronicle that the chain condemns all forms of human trafficking and sexual exploitation, and provides anti-human trafficking training to all team members at all properties. A Choice Hotels spokesperson told the Chronicle that the hotel chain is a signatory to ECPAT International’s Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism. Wyndham hotels didn’t comment. Deborah Sigmund, founder of Innocents at Risk, says “It’s one thing to sign the ECPAT’s Code of Conduct. It’s another to be dedicated to protecting women and children, and keeping them safe.” She notes Marriott Hotels signed the Code of Conduct, took out pornography on hotel TVs, hired undercover police, and are a “model of hotels fighting trafficking.” She says Sofitel Hotels, also a signatory to the Code of Conduct, is dedicated to fighting sexual trafficking of women and children. ""Unfortunately, some hotels care more about making a dollar than protecting innocent lives,"" Deborah says. Most of the calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline involve hotel incidents.

She told a State Department forum yesterday held by the Associates of the American Foreign Service Worldwide that human trafficking has grown from a $32 billion a year global business when she founded Innocents at Risk... in 2005 to a $150 billion a year business today. She related stories of young women from Moscow flying into Chicago, thinking they would become models in New York City, only to be forced into prostitution, and young girls coming from Brazil into Connecticut being told they would be nannies, only to end up in the sex trade run by organized crime. Ms. Sigmund said it's up to everyone to keep their eyes open in public places, and when you see a young person who stands out and doesn't appear to be in a normal situation, report it immediately to local authorities. Human trafficking is modern day slavery, and the most profitable component is forced sex labor. Alma Tucker, president of the International Network of Hearts, has founded three ""safe houses"" that are shelters in the San Diego and Tijuana area where victims of human trafficking can live, heal, study and work. She noted that Tijuana, Mexico, is now known for ""sexual tourism."" Both Sigmund and Tucker said the Internet has become a powerful tool for human traffickers to use to sell young people on the Dark Web. Sigmund noted that more money is spent fighting drugs than fighting human trafficking. She expressed concern about legislation coming up for a vote in the D.C. City Council that would decriminalize violations for buying sex or being in the sex trade.

IJM Thailand was informed by Thailand’s Department of Special Investigation (DSI) of a potential human trafficking and forced labor case that DSI had received from the migrant workers’ home embassy. According to the embassy, the workers stated they were illegally brought into the factory and wanted to leave but cou...ld not.   IJM staff assisted officers from DSI, the embassy and other Thai government agencies in a rescue operation at the factory. The officers attempted to call out to the workers who were locked on the upper floors of a building behind locked gates. Eventually, one worker began to climb out over the gate and a ladder was brought, to help him escape. The other migrant workers followed him to freedom, all of whom may be victims of forced labor and human trafficking. IJM Thailand’s legal and aftercare department assisted the freed workers and Thai authorities at the local police station during interviews and processing.  Now, the migrant workers will continue to receive IJM legal and aftercare support as the victim identification process continues. They are currently being cared for and supported by IJM and the government in a safe location.","2021-02-24T19:45:03","","https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/154144504_10159225478709729_5943269286963892939_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=da1649&_nc_ohc=GgTq7T1cV9AAX82AkBn&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=299afe84d65d3d3086a8a40c5f816fb5&oe=607E9BEC","https://www.facebook.com/InternationalJusticeMission/photos/a.176996189728/10159225478704729/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDgO4c-PrmX5s9sGjhi2l-_0BnTYW_wGn-cXRKCggwvZDPL58TDy8MUylcCf8Ww5UIAyaAcJJfbvOdZSiTzqTIWGhEAC6ezrOydaU8DIz35eWIPQOCqUUVdgIx5bJwYT3Vv1dt7AWR-lRLeyMNRwhopE5DVwhcKWuFoJmBSiUOL2QVZ387tT-NdfrV967dHemwjuJ5wHkyf1CtOnDHAcSTOXHnFxnp_DgoQiJNLgX9MFmh3XwYF_gRKg8chqaWofMBCDLTZFL3qtkn2kBTKC4x_3HZH1xZ_sMNfRTjU8EFIpGxR7YY&__tn__=-R"

In the past year, this team released an up-to-date and even more inclusive 3rd edition of the Not a Number curriculum, and have continued bringing it into new communities across the country.","2021-03-13T14:30:42","","https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/160242802_10157877515451088_3719473310897654225_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=asGQFoYm5aAAX_Zv9f6&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=d6971a7fcf81c4f8d2d8ee3684c10d14&oe=607B82E2","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/photos/a.99583116087/10157877515446088/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAUDS-j4WDEiDZ3F35yIvcW9JnpzbIghPL872-4H-5SdZZ1EJcP-s_2VsQMRThipLN6A4DPgxK1a3CK6TDx-hhXlgQQnpI0h2jKD6Aypfad70Uf7ngX8WoJXU7ONFsgvqOnwwDkOCobKmpngftvYcPjSamuGAY7YjblKnT8JxcApamGjYfb6TiPPYsceyUWb7Bn7tZAvh_aoMJIwMNtIJH5eVLgYCmsRZ56BRwqzYSYt285VsrBu3GOSO_ORJPKkOdjaOOzrKBT8B0Ws3a6YCPlEh4GMu6OMA6Q4OlxAVqZ6mIwLkg&__tn__=-R"

"507",10157793789451088,"Love146",7,59,27,0,12,0,0,0,98,0,"This is a Rapid Response Backpack. When our US Survivor Care Social Workers meet a child for the first time, it's typically at a Rapid Response.  A Rapid Response is a conversation. We talk about the grooming process traffickers use, how to stay safe online, healthy relationships, and ways out of potentially dangerous situations. We listen. We hear more about what they've experienced. Sometimes we practice calling various hotlines together. We give their caregivers and servic...e providers recommendations of what to do next. If that child has been trafficked (or are highly suspected of being trafficked), a Rapid Response is usually the first of much more time we spend with them.  To support, we bring them a backpack. Sometimes that backpack gets a child to sit down with us when they wouldn't have wanted to give us the time of day. Other times, that backpack serves as an important excuse they can use to explain to others why they agreed to talk with us. The backpack is filled with a range of items children and service providers have identified as being critical for this population. Each of the items inside the Backpacks was thoughtfully chosen based on our experience and conversations with others. From nut-free granola bars to fuzzy teddy bears, and alcohol-free hand sanitizer to activity books, each specific item meets health and safety concerns, and was selected to ensure that children receive critical resources as well as the feeling of being valued. Our Long-Term Care clients come to us first through a Rapid Response. But not all youth we meet with move on to receive Long-Term Case. Even for those who don't continue to receive services, a Rapid Response ensures they have information and resources to help them stay safe and supported. Over many years, supporters like you have sent supplies for the backpacks from our Amazon wish list or you’ve come to our office and assembled backpacks for youth. This month, a Rapid Response Backpack went on display at the Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin Texas, in an exhibit called “Not Alone.” If you’re in Texas and want to go see, it will be on display at the Bullock Museum until the end of May.","2021-02-02T18:54:13","","https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/145330426_10157793789456088_3264563976546475500_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=0MMUvVdU-A0AX-rkpiH&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=b3c6ec414c13923b8b4e93f55d5ec777&oe=607C3F9B","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/photos/a.99583116087/10157793789451088/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA68gc7oJZ332pi9ZNZf-9aBb8s_7-Wh1bxjc923BNQL3Ki9MHlEdr-nKLL55ibtCHX5IcOg4q3VKUrzYDuNHK19-u6MAyqfgxQhLVY2RqlNBncbqFgnJwy7knK9_Q4ODTfQ-YFDQZKMPn8lhl-sSJbfVBzZskL3bMVx_ceSMfvoc0ed1xgJmpwy8wLEdkN30Wfn6kTsswo5Um1ich5EkTGlTKq1IOgUWJjcYygVoIUepPqdERa3z4p6PpLhKndgTcaVagwtt5rw4lFEmJ3SniYAi-ZBtvGH-YqDerZ7UYSDWJfbEU&__tn__=-R"

A key to preventing trafficking is knowing that traffickers use youth's vulnerabilities to target their victims. There are many forces and situations that cause vulnerability in a child’s life. So for each of us, caring about child trafficking means considering and connecting with a LOT of other issues. Last year for HT Prevention Month, we addressed some basic facts & myths related to child trafficking. This year, we want to take a look wider than just child trafficking, and talk about other issues that are very much related and critical for prevention. We’re going to focus on just a few common vulnerabilities this month; we’ll share how that issue relates to child trafficking, how COVID has exacerbated it, how our programs respond, and what you can do to help.","2021-01-04T14:58:20","","https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p261x260/135619817_10157720791141088_9018226471579121486_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=UC0wJp6mO0YAX9s7Jw0&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=0d56cdf96a9d015bedd4f50e33e45d6b&oe=607CE0BA https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p261x260/135804743_10157720791331088_4996713203166193050_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=qmN-TEd4QmEAX-8O3N-&_nc_oc=AQlYVVGDrrvX_Mpwl1P2KsGziMf2WYAvRK022KGkRrjDTbMgv_7qHL7qQCE1eUtPQpPNGnrqWtuLMzbBZmQUTgjw&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=4dd1c8a8fcefaa308ce29690c255961e&oe=607B502A https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p261x260/135829750_10157720791506088_7127623724820586835_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=N9xZF-Jen4oAX9f5M6V&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=4a28ce504a057ac1851bce410557f006&oe=607BC36D https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p261x260/135493346_10157720791581088_5319994579824752137_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=kib7n42t3TMAX_grr9A&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=e19d0811a724bc1cefd56da5eac58baf&oe=607BE0E9","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/posts/10157720791891088?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDFeAPntwGOb-ElrZhVX__UBFFPM7qWJdAB914AJxQ-lW-B8JV_7xm1eLSkm1mQjRaDkA_pxsHTq1ev2_D0FsI7ANWthCKPmlpVgkl3CfYdVQkiYIN1jOfcrXOha3HboK4FKXx1JU-xc7vVlgJqLkS88aomdDDILxBxShCSSeZ0KUUrAL5g5FfTtk5uy1pFMhBwg-HCdyWasRVXsKSu3TOSI-x5O3676BUwSVohtG1pfsTlhCqEfTh6MjtPVNdDmXT5JNAuJV_K5ichMDzmMwtno_Dj71g7weDJePxRFsY6PuS2icE&__tn__=-R"

We have also been caught off guard by generosity, perseverance, defiant hope, and even unfiltered joy.  We’ve seen these things profoundly displayed in the lives of the children... and youth we work with. And we have seen it in you. We have heard the oft-used description this year, “essential workers”, which has included everyone from frontline medical professionals to grocery store clerks. The people we can’t live without came clearly into focus. As a supporter of Love146, you are our equivalent of “essential workers.” We simply could not provide the care needed for survivors of child trafficking, or do the work we do to prevent children from being exploited....without you. You sustain this work and your friendship sustains us.  Thank you for helping add so much “beautiful” to a year that had the potential to only be “terrible."" You are more than essential.

Believe it or not, combating child trafficking and exploitation is something our national leaders have agreed on for decades.

It was reauthorized and strengthened under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump and congresses led by both Republicans and Democrats. Love146's... VP of Global Programs, Erin Williamson, serves on the National Advisory Committee on the Sex Trafficking of Children & Youth in the United States. The Committee was appointed by President Obama and launched in 2017, under President Trump. Like most of America, Committee members represent diverse experiences and opinions. We don’t always agree. But, we’ve experienced a remarkable commitment to work through differences and towards solutions and witnessed inspiring collaboration. Many assume that ending child trafficking just requires us — as individuals — to care enough. But that alone won't do it. We also need systems and policies to change. Does that mean systems and policies are trafficking children? No. But it means that if they're working right, they can stop and prevent trafficking. Ending child trafficking will require challenging society's response. This is driven by both individual action and system change.","2020-10-22T19:40:38","","https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s261x260/122117423_10157566885636088_3045331570937291823_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=Egsn5DnOI_wAX-Gp32p&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=378a5e82f451c121b14ed65585018812&oe=607E874D https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s261x260/122507532_10157566885681088_2562879187941562109_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=RNyqqGoienYAX9YrIB9&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=673391f365297cbc13f2e13403c33b9f&oe=607D6FAF https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s261x260/122170664_10157566885776088_6901529183252761033_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=l_3OWVzmR5MAX80huTi&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=f2b2943191c5139dd86e88d16898f923&oe=607D8FB0 https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s261x260/122321438_10157566885996088_8633771614467584369_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=7new-PiGwfAAX_4mlvN&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=b2a2d7319b6442dcf970b26407020e25&oe=607BCA10","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/posts/10157566886461088?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDXovEvt1XdJ13bdreFfzaWLgmMItq07AsbQtQros1eJ2pKzba795MibxmBR0DdmMAKxgGBGMEDFfoJc0lcYK7tj23qZyTX0AH4aNwoaze_K2vuDwiQG_Ox5uKJQCF24zJaZp3a_u-BYak8gwHPkzoGtQkqIaJFHCvd-SG1FUl1KAajMJUlo8xJkPWdTsB2OsQZpRr5pW9PxgNl7wCXkNyr7ecLEd6S__jm_nFpawktbfzeeNxOXYXQVs9OKKa4Fc0vGZlnxQ_nEikjQuDSUSOJ3GjVxYNn6HOQqx25c4fIH4SugL4&__tn__=-R"

We are living in a time that’s increasingly polarized. An “us and them” culture permeates so many areas of our lives. This is especially clear as one of the most contentious elections in recent memory draws closer. So many of us are trying to navigate relationships with friends, family, and co-workers who see the world differently than we do. ...These conversations seem more uncomfortable and harder than ever. This is made worse by separation created by quarantine and our increased reliance on social media, where it’s far easier to be confrontational in a tweet or a Facebook post than when we can sit and talk things over with a friend. At Love146, we have been very deliberate in creating what we call a “big table”. We recognize that people come into the movement to end child trafficking carrying their own opinions and agendas on a ton of different issues. That can create tension, but more often than not, we are inspired by the mix of people willing to join us at the table. Whatever “us” and “them” represent for you, if you care about ending child trafficking then there is a place for you at the table. I get that it’s sometimes really hard to intentionally share space with people who have a different viewpoint than us. But in the end, we hope that each of us here cares more about fighting for children, than we do about fighting against each other. In a world full of hidden (and not so hidden) agendas, we have only one: The end of child trafficking and exploitation. Nothing less. We don’t have all the answers. No one does. We come to the table as learners, and we invite you to do the same, knowing that we will always do what we believe is best for children, based on research and our 18 years of experience. Though we have our differences, maybe now more than ever, we can agree there is value in naming some of the things that bring us together. Ending child trafficking is one of them. When it comes to creating a safer world for children, we really are all in this together. When someone looks into the Love146 room and asks, 'Who’s in there?,' we can together respond with conviction… 'It’s just us.'"" - Rob Morris, Love146 CEO & Co-founder","2020-10-16T14:31:15","","https://external.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQE0mjA5mTo9LIVW&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Flove146.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2Fpexels-joa%CC%83o-jesus-921322-scaled.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&ccb=3-4&_nc_hash=AQGvqjal29yWg3u7","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/posts/10157553092001088?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAc2QSqiAVz9rtS8OrPSXu1TMkK1xlYQ9-Mxcggc0K043CQfRl5ean5QKx_87aAWIQtnx3ApApeYTW890rtRirRPg3VJn8nKOtjufRPtrqbkhKbEF1CJk2a6lZ26CWDjr6WMmRJ_UTndnZw_TvfCc3aieSEFZ41G1VuZatVpY4QsZTfZCIUOw--LIYFJjuWiBsECDP08K9gvXxIg8e9OeIqgWT6voyAfQcFCLXM2ZiUmPCABthJNXBQn_oJilIBHNV5Hx0VHijxAiZ2XK0RxO-2FoiaFEcGGCeUQ8MtKrAJ9Hl1WN0&__tn__=-R"

Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice  awarded funds that will allow the CCRC to partner with Love146’s US Survivor Care Program and take first steps towards a rigorous evaluation that will measure its effectiveness. “This can be a difficult population to help,” said study director Lisa Jones, research associate professor of psychology. “Victims often have multiple problems like abusive families, foster care histories, running away and substance abuse.

First celebrated in 1929, this day was created to increase awareness about the importance of health in children. However, we know that there is more to child’s well-being than what you see with your eyes. Mental health is exceptionally important to a child’s wellness. How does this relate to our work ending child trafficking? Research has found that survivors of child trafficking often experience depression, PTSD, and other mental health is...sues during and after being trafficked. 65% of the children come into our survivor care with a history of mental illness. The cause of experiencing mental health issues in survivors of child trafficking can be due to the duration of their experience, abuse prior to and while being trafficked, social support, and unmet needs. There is little known about the influence of human trafficking on mental health in various genders, races, and ethnic groups. We know that Black and Latinx children and girls are more likely to experience trafficking. Some studies have found that trafficked girls experienced depression and anxiety. However, a lack of research in mental health issues and vulnerable groups leaves unanswered questions and gaps in service provision. As we recognize National Child Health Day, keep in mind the various ways children can be affected by human trafficking and how this information intersects with our work.","2020-10-05T18:57:07","","https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/120541658_10157529693281088_7135853237951898014_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=tZzvw1KjKhsAX9jR9wm&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=35e2348ef1219888cc326859d97f3401&oe=607E7014","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/photos/a.99583116087/10157529693276088/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA3bTYijxe8TKPMhcSmSJbBeq3pDHODHQD6RhGzdUyyPcxNBeFmLo1-AaEviCUk_R-FQYo0es8hTDqca337_1tNl_D4ek5z-HrkLXBU0optUUqrS_lQEX8c0vRuFDF3yvHiAbrD232tqMfg8Zptz83Pc9EPfB-RvgoEX3oNxM93oYdp_GrEsK6p5XsArSh4c-tKIy_s1urxqiGzqCYbo46HPEYQC1ihB0JJ_H_qCUAWIKd0UkupRxetZX52XpsHYUVsgfB37t4C6kFzbAlc3E_rUoqbG6YeR_NS84TdRicFFT35trU&__tn__=-R"

Between 40,000-50,000 people will take their own lives this year. For many of us, this hits close to home. I’m one of those. Someone dear to me took their own life. I live with the loss and carry a sadness that I never expect to leave me, along with so many haunting and unanswered questions. Unsurprisingly, suicide is a risk for victims of tra...fficking. In our survivor care program in The Philippines, 30% or more of the children we care for have experienced thoughts of suicide. Here in our US Survivor Care Program, 47% of the survivors we work with have considered suicide and 45% have deliberately harmed their body - for example, cut or burned themselves - to cope with intense emotional feelings and pain. Those are crushing numbers. It’s those numbers that make me so deeply grateful for my front line colleagues at Love146, working everyday with children who might be considering suicide or self-harm. At Love146, we provide wrap around, holistic care for those working through the immense trauma of child trafficking. My co-workers are there everyday, helping a child filled with potential know they are loved and learn to respond to temporary (but really hard) circumstances without feeling like their only options are suicide or self-harm. Love146 is there to show children who have been trafficked another way forward. We don’t ever want those who love these children to live with the loss, sadness, and haunting “what if?”, questions that too many of us know too well. When you give to Love146, you’re providing  protection and care for individual children, ranging in age from infants and toddlers to teens and young adults, who have been trafficked and exploited or are at risk.","2020-09-25T18:36:51","","","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/posts/10157508796921088?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARB8iPYJl0neM3EUtjq2JFqXjMl5PfPBwoAQuei_JBMWi7tYnj7oSCgUosBV7OmPvQlrqDnSbJsX_bTK8YtIS2VH_ME5i4Qnbmypmzq1WdRDnIWXGVwwH_tq49d9NiOyr-lqkrhyle1HaVagtYg9l5UHGeJE7JciKl7rvNn6cYAzkK5NoUJ4P52zddw7KefoJk0YhKkreN40YdUiUIKKwNBF-ZGUPK8IXGsBnBCAj0P84Aa2u1mzmf6oWOuzIvvZiellKg7iu9YPMWKTSrAt0gVUTdBd3SZT-aMYS4OUxB-nZQY5AB0&__tn__=-R"

On this World Day against Trafficking in Persons, let us pledge to work for inclusive societies and economies that leave no one behind.” #humantrafficking #worlddayagainsttrafficking #covid19 #humanrights #recovery #humandignity #covidresponse","2020-07-30T18:10:54","","https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/115962267_10157381917156088_363431364172445397_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=ZQEv2N41x64AX_TGcQI&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=a05d37a2209b17692b0e2d130aa00097&oe=607CD074","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/photos/a.99583116087/10157381917151088/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC0X-5v3KK90W4lg4A9ZImQkXbPEbeybevYbkGhCbrFkLcMUNzilYM4Xvfd-LOGh-01UF7XKKTqgFJMadGkNUxF39Yh4Erw3xkCmRtteCJ8ajj9IaCKIViH9TxeKdNnYdTzXpuLQF-XYb1GWp6m-fdrNNaANNyQQOMsqCHAeERgWZxOM3qkXb7EYVKTTdZhURtZOK2_B-HkBXN8DtY-ch2oypyqe8oHYcmlh1yByRiFZQCDy1dDMWl4rzd0NzNe1yarHNMdslePGUlSwFXqIOeurjR4WgDtK6bwdrxWRnXX1aiLP7s&__tn__=-R"

Love146 and many other activists on this issue began to come alive at this time in history.  When the world named it, and began noticing that it was occurring to so many people - including millions of children - it felt awful. When we start shin...ing a light on something it can seem like the problem is intensifying or it seems worse to those who had never noticed it. We hear people say things like “This wasn’t happening back in the old days.” But this is not true. Bygone eras weren't better times. For some, realizing there's a problem does give the feeling that world is getting worse. Even though that isn’t necessarily true, your feelings about this problem do matter! Your rage, indignation, determination, defiant hope, it all matters — especially what you do next with it.

It’s insanely easy for predators to open an account with a fake identity, and send out lots of friend requests. Some of us want as many online friends as possible, and will hit “accept” even if we’re not sure we know them.

Here are some of the red flags that a relationship isn't healthy: 🚩The person asks you to DM them, or chat through a private channel, like WhatsApp.  🚩They ask if you are alone 🚩They ask you to send them a pic.  🚩They offer you a job where you can “earn money fast.” 🚩They threaten you if you don’t do what they ask. If you get these or similar messages from someone you’re well connected to or can’t separate from, get help by calling the CyberTipline at 1-800-843-5678. If this is an online connection and you can block them and unfriend them, do that. Here’s a place to check out more redflags: https://love146.org/action/online-safety/","2020-05-18T14:06:10","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/videos/949524028852339","","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/videos/949524028852339/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCD4EltUkey0AnLolRSN5P8t_UNcpHcCo01_JoDYAMVP18bqaMhnc8vDWUBcJ3Zj40tfQ2y-zalDPhh15Xth1lzB1oe8LRmPFOBw_8KF8gACnK4uT8i-hdwLOXI74Eqdt1yBvgjKv8FWDEN4jlJfqGHfTx1jYWp0A0RJxBT2XNJMDDWFvcdWaYc5PBC3MRcMyb1tlFrTj7Xqknr8klsv0OZx8IBWMlLlw5LIi7iIGZOJXTsLqsl0gQCYB7Uoo27a_p6yvjNYi0hUFO7zzaxnXYZsOAQEstzezYjHBmxoJmKGn2_18fgWERTTY7BMLg&__tn__=-R"

Here’s a tip to stay safe for you, or to pass along to youth in your life: Be a tiny bit paranoid that what you send or post could be reshared — now, or in the future. Because once you post something, a picture or a few embarrassing sentences, you can’t always control how it will be seen — or whether it’ll be shared by others. If you feel like there’s any chance that a picture or post could get into the wrong hands, don’t... risk it, don’t share or post it.

Think about things like listening to music, going for a walk, drawing, exercising, writing in a journal, or yoga. Whatever works for you.  Then ...write them down for when you need a reminder. The more of these kinds of coping skills the better! Each coping skill is a tool in your toolbox. If a sad, scared, or angry thought comes to your mind, that’s OK!

As a response to the unprecedented need caused by COVID-19, The GivingTuesday community has called for #GivingTuesdayNow – a global day of generosity & unity. When coronavirus struck, it quickly became apparent that for many of the survivors in our care, getting basic needs met was going to be a challenge and this puts children at risk of being trafficked again. During this critical time, your donations are meeting survivors’ very practical needs: ...You’ve paid rent. You’ve bought groceries. You’ve sent hygiene products. You’ve ensured survivors have the school supplies needed to keep persevering in their education. And in the Philippines, you've ensured survivors have all their needs met while sheltering in our safe home. And your donations have gone beyond practical needs, providing continued care and connection for survivors. Your donations protect children.

But we know that everything is connected; intersectional. Including the environment. And so nature and the earth finds its way into our Survivor Care programs in many ways. 🌏 We bring youth to wilderness school, for snowshoeing treks, ropes courses, and mountain hikes. We do beach retreats. We climb volcanoes on horseback. We have a farm in the Philippines tha...t children help tend to. Goats and chickens and catfish and other animals that they care for. We do beekeeping! (With stingless bees, of course). We incorporate caring for others – and the earth – as a way to allow the children to be active participants in restoring the world around them. And discovering, in a deeper way, their own power. The children also use reflection on nature as a part of their healing process. So we’ll leave you this Earth Day with a few quotes from children, about how the earth itself sparks their realizations of recovery: 🌾 “I’m like the grass: even though it is stepped on again and again, it rises again and again. It can be cut down, but it grows back. The grass refuses to stay down. Like me.” 🌊 “I’m like the sea. The sea is full of life and beauty, and no matter what it is done to it, it is still a sea. Like the sea, I will always rise. No one can make the sea smaller.” 🌳 “I used to be like this leaf. When the storm comes the leaves of the tree fall. Just like the times when I felt that I was the tree whose leaves all fell — hopeless. I felt that my life was hopeless. ...But now, I’m different. I’m like a strong tree that no one can fool anymore. I can not be downtrodden and laughed at anymore...It was here that I felt loved. It was here that I became strong. It was here that I learned how to be loved.”","2020-04-22T11:43:57","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/videos/2529782043938350","","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/videos/2529782043938350/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDhOZzHqYBmrb2I026w6ic939QL2pzGgNP9U2sOxrbDM_noxksRVBt8DrV4KpIxFVp8nzOiUIurkBgCIQe_E_uj8Qe6k_MmBe-i3mLeeVMe1DPpXBEEFasJNd8NNrT8M62nhVxYbAZKQDOWE8IsBDqT0C5W-UrNbD_0BFsj9N6qP8_mGWEln2voXG0BY6ntzL7hkajkIRqQb893VdyY3YLgMagfztToTADIj40ji-TzfOtHPdsdwqyyC9CPvVHhjmENDtR6jJWGO0Dt4-ArW9HTWkIVjqE2H5J1fT98ZaaiexgKv7i7TMmqJjNC-duwCdxhrbNgmS5bHLt2AA0&__tn__=-R"

Now, because of COVID-19, we’re sheltering in place in our safe homes. 2020 has been difficult because one of the most important things for children recovering from trauma is stability. It’s a struggle — and we know that our presence and calm in the chaos is what we must offer right now. The safe home is like an oasis. I’ve al...ways said: A safe home should be safe, and a safe home should be a home. And that is truer today than ever: children must know they will not experience danger or lack right now. We are defending them. Even before it was ordered, the children were pulled from school, and are homeschooling. While the daily activities are structured around education, even though we’ve locked down the safe home, everybody is having fun. All staff now stay in, except for those who are buying food. Food access locally is an issue for us and many supermarkets are skeletal at this point, so we’re relying more and more on our own safe home farm. We have chickens, catfish ponds, beekeeping, mushroom growing, and many vegetables from our farm. We use moringa and papaya leaves grown on our property to boost immunity. We’ve always used our garden and farm therapeutically, but they mean even more to the children now. What also means so much is knowing we are all in this together as humanity. That includes you. So in that spirit, let these words directly from the children in our care encourage you today, as we survive together: “You need to fight. Strengthen your body’s resistance and be brave. Do not panic and avoid crowds.” “What the world experiences today will soon end. It will turn into light, and the fear that the people feel will soon be gone.” Thank you for being steady for children during this time when they need it.","2020-04-18T12:11:18","","","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/posts/10157081135411088?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBkKfnl2acZAC1Z0wRG3zj_NZNQpxIbGei8e7YpjQ_jWbIk6_MuuUuYrr7OQXL8lruJRSkHLCql1xi7fkAjIjBe5E2iDlfPVVTqkbFWB3V7Z7nzFoXz0Xmg_mKF2qjujuuAAeBi4Ls7C_yJB_yc9qXu7Tab2TC7ZRiQjyag4zEim-tU8nlEGoWhG96Fk_VvgUdrwWaRbUDI3EM7eiUtApA9_jT60lvXaUURpVbtz7WtWOXkvR3zqJDVVn6qZAbH_SiO_H8steTo6w0619czCf3G7WGKcMcH4YGVXAdjFsDOS2TROao&__tn__=-R"

Hope is the thing that is left to us, in a bad time. I shall get up in the morning and wind the clock, as a contribution to order and steadfastness. Sailors have an expression about the weather: they say, th...e weather is a great bluffer. I guess the same is true of our human society — things can look dark, then a break shows in the clouds, and all is changed, sometimes rather suddenly. It is quite obvious that the human race has made a mess of life on this planet. But as a people we probably harbor seeds of goodness that have lain for a long time waiting to sprout when the conditions are right. Man’s curiosity, his relentlessness, his inventiveness, his ingenuity have led him into deep trouble. We can only hope that these same traits will enable him to claw his way out. Hang on to your hat.

What was startling about watching the economic downturn 12 years ago in 2008 was realizing that kids would have such increased vulnerability. This crisis is showing even more severe impacts. Many children and families are cut-off from school meals and food pantries. People will be newly facing homelessness. Children won’t be able to see the teachers, coaches, youth group leaders, and counselors who made them fe...el safe. Children who are used to connection and excitement may experience a void. These are the same factors that make children at increased risk of trafficking. Kids need food, safe places to call home, and nurturing people to provide stability and support. If you and I aren't providing that for them a predator could be. Love146 will continue to hold steady for the survivors in our care today, and we know our prevention work has strengthened thousands of children already.  While our frontline staff are still serving youth, it will take more than one dedicated organization to support all the children who need help. If there are youth you’ve been connected to, keep reaching out to them across the physical distance. If your school system isn't putting plans in place to make sure kids have meals, you could be that voice. If your town isn't talking about how to support families and provide stability and connection, you could be that voice. I don't have all the answers, but we must do our part in making sure that the people who are making decisions know that we care, that kids matter, and that this is a top priority to us all.","2020-03-27T15:06:38","","https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x395/91004778_10157008135256088_970189814601089024_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=E-_yzst1VTUAX8qHG3f&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=dc63f928ca6473600fa34a183802ba14&oe=607C63B8","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/photos/a.99583116087/10157008135246088/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA42BVT6XyHtHw16Nns3QPNx9hdQ725nn1-EWYeZPqg2U_nvpuxBN38BlKyuIit5V8t9U6u0z72uQ2Oea3Y8oJntM3LAg51gqZKS99Ae2EXN4-zW-x9K7llQufvjyWzd8aOYIO1R0EA0UgzqNWx50-g9ygAuTJR4KV06JB_6A-2aOghdZF5uf-dN8QRGXDaeqnwrNx00SkcSPkkebN1XS-xpLfRmd8fuyUQTcohkpCcgEZlbe6MjKZogu7Rf1DX8V9WGh0IGcuhw2NQyR8omwrfKfcMbEcjQZiTR3urP0tpOZR6G4I&__tn__=-R"

One thing she said was: ""Love146 will never abandon me, because Love146 is my family.” Many of you have reached out with concerns about COVID-19. During this pandemic, we are committed to staying a constant in a child’s life. One thing that’s clear: the needs of children won’t go away. As schools and many community activities close, many children will spend more time online. This is where most youth ...in our care met their traffickers. They may be more lonely, stressed, or even burdened by added financial strain their families will go through. Traffickers see opportunity here and certainly won’t stop working right now. We cannot stop working either. We’re being responsive as new information becomes clear. But these are the present steps we’re taking to keep our staff and the children we care for as safe as possible. Children in our safe homes in the Philippines are all moving to homeschooling. We’ll continue to connect with and be available for youth in the US Survivor Care program. We're still getting calls about children who need help, and we're answering those calls. Our offices are working from home and avoiding mass transit. Trainings, meetings, and events over the coming months are being handled case by case, and we’re watching closely to decide what gets cancelled and postponed. If you’re wondering how you can help right now, the biggest need is to hold steady in our commitment to be there for children. The weeks ahead will be stressful. It will be easy for many people to put charitable giving aside, and many nonprofits are understandably worried. One of the best things you can do today is give whatever you can. If you haven’t yet, set up a monthly gift, of whatever amount you can. And right now, still, there is a donor who is adding $100 to your first monthly gift. www.love146.org/monthly Many of us are rightfully concerned about those we love who are vulnerable because of their advanced age or compromised immune systems. Having experienced complex trauma is also a vulnerability that can impact our body’s ability to fight off disease. Know that the support you’ve given to protect children and help survivors recover from trauma is an investment in more resilience through this and future trials.","2020-03-13T21:47:28","","https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/90046215_10156962843816088_6138500467853885440_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=quVae4anNKYAX-w30VO&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=62106ea01a29e7dd48a22004c2f20f03&oe=607AFD18","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/photos/a.99583116087/10156962843806088/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARA6QaqLbosEeBANJiutI9D6LHMwfgMmngQAYQdIEi3VyvtCobBIsotGuRJV1FiPYuB4lfmp_9hMXSxq3XDpxB-gwTd3kON_EBUnPW1lU6hXarzzzLuksfe1egaq4UZkPngfvnlgk_ac_7bsCtIA3A9hTvjantzW8qHgaWnCIpIA2gMvHkqXnCRw0orC4V8g-wA-gkscLHX92QysiuneIuTVDGaYARwSYqCvQ9-6qNxXfMEAweylo9tjg340WzQ2jNSPfONKVrNxx9vlAcLtDY--nQTKk0yqPk0Wg-Y7P6aaTRHNC94&__tn__=-R"

Ten women have filed a lawsuit accusing Nygard of sexual assault, and using his company and employees to obtain young victims and give them alcohol and drugs. (Nygard is also the target of a sex trafficking inves...tigation in New York City.) The lawsuit's allegations resemble the crimes that Jeffrey Epstein was accused of: Nygard is said to have “shared women with local politicians,” and “groomed victims to recruit ’fresh meat,’” according to The New York Times and other reports. The alleged victims were said to have been “lured to Nygard’s Bahamian home by the prospect of modeling jobs or a taste of luxury.” He and Epstein are even said to have shared a connection with Prince Andrew. “He preys on poor people’s little girls,” Natasha Taylor, who worked there for five years, told the Times. (Through a spokesman, Nygard has denied the allegations.) Recent cases are sending a message that even the rich and powerful can’t commit these crimes without facing justice.","2020-02-27T20:50:00","","https://external.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQHGatptU4ZadBVt&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic01.nyt.com%2Fimages%2F2020%2F02%2F23%2Fworld%2F23BAHAMAS-FIGHT-1%2F00BAHAMAS-FIGHT-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_cb=1&ccb=3-4&_nc_hash=AQFDNGKTr86_HOC1","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/posts/10156923293426088?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCgzNDFnzEJ3NNmYqzpKe1m-TfpMIB2AyVvY1MiktgHuki7J_1LteTiTbimhusFO2xl0H5JM9eLtY5u2sp1BhhbTBocj-eOK5Vr1itrg49aNFVxNezlp4AsDFt9A_GyvelJBrdqpUw0_wMGTyKq1y3n1usg4kZYv3-lpFGCqyJPm-IjBvyTNYRqfaLMrZxnGMrnzH6C8X2DOgZj8DB9JLhv428D5b85wtPhKSYSfLWNoyxLFWaoKZdkbRq39Pg2vf1EmVqPahmzYAtjSWvr_gGH3eyJcO8-ahPj0Se0FDX850LANLk&__tn__=-R"

He believed that people naturally respond to symbolism in their quest for identification and that it is a powerful means of “inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols.” Throughout history symbolis...m has been used to inspire and galvanize social movements. Symbols have even helped unite people within a movement who have differing philosophies, approaches and agendas for a common good. Sometimes words aren’t even necessary. Symbols can speak volumes in their imagery, history and the feelings they provoke. And, at the end of the day, symbols don’t bring about any meaningful change. But the people behind them do. A symbol doesn’t change anything. People do. And if a symbol can help “induce cooperation” and inspire more people to the fight… then we’re in. So… a red ‘X’ or 146 won’t end child trafficking.

Trafficking disproportionately affects people of color. When we’ve looked at records* of how many children are referred for trafficking se...rvices or whose cases have been investigated, we’re finding that children of color are about 4x times more likely to be trafficked than white children. It’s important that we recognize the intersection between trafficking and racism in order to address the root causes and be proactive about transforming the systems that perpetuate these injustices. /// *Citation: The US Department of Justice found that between 2008 and 2010, children of color accounted for 77.8% of child sex trafficking cases they investigated, compared to the 48% of nonwhite in the general population, according to the US Census during this time. In Connecticut, where Love146’s US Survivor Care program is based, 73% of all child sex trafficking referrals to the state’s Department of Children and Families in 2018 were children of color, compared to 43% of children being nonwhite in the Connecticut state general population at that time.","2020-01-20T12:00:00","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/videos/879481455834252","","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/videos/879481455834252/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDBqODkSOM2XqQVpzP-udPCvoN6m2-sHIC1gKVb511F3_983W7Ns1khiSvDcLbga9rTVWsfx1wcm2-3XSArkU4flAo4rWisadFbHnQO5iEVjhDAJ0JR8IGLzuSvdSv-Km0_K1tAVOCdYV5ufpuCAXbw_uHFRKgQWd7gRgzjR8X14pw_suEC6DVOSLRiWtFIjcpp36e-TJMR7IZYfvsnAm1HNSGACDogccScW-q5EhhtXa-liiemEbwI1riIXqiwLeaQM87zfxtBN8DHeyqAREfEqckXQ-OzyKZYKsEGPQLAuPB3CR6hcoNeObMbQR8&__tn__=-R"

Because of the momentum of this movement, that changed. On this day 1 decade ago, people like Jeffrey Epstein, R. Kelly, and many others were exploiting victims with impunity. Because of the momentum of this movement, ...that changed. And because of you, I believe a decade from now things will be very different. Last year, we received more referrals for trafficked youth than ever before. And our gut says that 2020, we’ll probably top that. But this is not cause for despair. Rather, our society and systems are seeing the problem where we didn’t see it before! We’re responding to the needs of children and coming together to make this a safer world for them. This isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. We won’t end child trafficking in the next decade. But hear us: we are winning. Pace yourself and don’t get tired. Keep listening to survivors.

Your child could be in their bedroom and be groomed and recruited by a predator. We all need to be paying a lot more attention to this virtual world because, especially for adolescent youth, that world is so critical to their personal identity. What can you do? Talk with your children about how to stay safe online. Explain that you understand their desire ...for privacy, but that it’s your job as a parent to keep them safe. Be aware of their online activities. Learn about the games they’re playing. Hang out with them while they play, and ask them questions. Help them know that people they meet online may not be who they say they are, and that they shouldn’t chat with anyone they don’t know. Caution them to never send photos to anyone. Finally, let your child know that if they are uncomfortable with something, or if they have done something that’s making them nervous or if they have been threatened, they can talk with an adult they trust.

That's what makes prevention so difficult, because it takes time.” ••• See Rob’s full speech at https://bit.ly/2J0ZrTV.","2019-10-17T18:57:26","","https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/72475769_10156572894251088_3360061681412603904_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=vJnYzbV3Sp0AX8DSKp0&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=75026c1abdff1bd599d532f0b5b61a8f&oe=607C98BC","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/photos/a.99583116087/10156572894246088/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCzdtx0f59UPHTn-fivuafJad9hqp_espgy1Hyz2-GJwYkVULjAUw-fmJlMjnKE7h6jdlClpTy2osW9xhHGX49vnyhgp4HVZAaoxxGdE9YMWbKmt8V78lEYFA5IOrQ3W3x2pGQPFaPTq6sMdbdZa4OfB2j-Ftw1_c-7dSJho2zmsEUNJoHrRgWBrB6G0TZDRpwN_HggJmnCy6Tv1TYGIYedFguGZFPCyeeg25eml3CD_eVZlkDFdo-iA9olaBbboDyN92cVumbfynYXKKqVygfLqjbgQsWEw9OnwWWWfpPOwvIfxMk&__tn__=-R"

In addition to tens of thousands cared for through prevention, our US Survivor Care program just did our 500th “rapid response.” Rapid Responses are one-time meetings with youth who are at high risk of trafficking, or are suspected or confirmed victims. We listen, give resources, help them realize it’s not their fault, and talk about how to find safety and... support. Afterwards, we make suggestions to their caregivers & social workers about follow up (which sometimes leads to that youth joining our long-term Survivor Care). Every youth who receives a Rapid Response gets to walk away with a backpack full of things like a blanket, granola bars, gloves, a teddy bear, deodorant, a card with hotlines, a cell phone that can call 911, chapstick, colored pencils, and lots of other goodies. Love146 also provides long term holistic survivor care in the U.S., journeying with survivors for many months. Some youth that receive a rapid response go on to get that level of care, and every youth in our long-term care begins with a Rapid Response.","2019-10-07T18:24:46","","https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/71927968_10156544394401088_674383747499425792_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=8_dgg0cEOZwAX8Li9jW&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=965cbf262d0e1ada657f97b16f3ef53f&oe=607E5CE6","https://www.facebook.com/love146.org/photos/a.99583116087/10156544394391088/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDH-RqFJ_N6Sz2KR6M-NsSKbebnIBzSmFTS38S18XCI6UTzNCzwxFqg2mG8Y1iQrdDhE9Ery3f1WqOkfYT67LxZe0ggBTglIARG6iB4HUr5Gd_4XmHyZ1NKbDU-MufGMkOqMbfmFEdSiKtl8q87o77419HPbL8GapNaectbIOWzl5kRQpif6zS5T90BX6gcDoUR3BhT3yihflIZC3mjK8fi5fl8blpi7gPioyJcZ5gzK_PrNWQzzFzpEuSOmFHajdLdikxaLC9Yd4JwL8gOp43_ovpe1OlJZg6h5zAiEw4ZIlOaTdc&__tn__=-R"

Today is Ian’s final post:  ●●●  “We are deeply dependent on the ocean. My posts over the past week have show horrifying abuses that take place on our seas. All of these types of abus...es stem from a core problem, which is a lack of governance at sea, especially on the high seas. Specifically, there are three ways in which misbehavior happens offshore routinely and with impunity: too few rules, a lack of enforcement, and insufficient awareness of what is happening there. All of these problems are also connected in that they occur with a certain tacit complicity from all of us who live on land. We all are the beneficiaries of the lawlessness on the high seas, where 90 percent of all the products we consume comes by way of ships, and the commercial channels are usually unbothered by the government and therefore, rules. We have been able to access impossibly cheap products that arrive to our shelves with incredible speed. Ninety percent of everything travels by ship, 50 percent of our oxygen is from the ocean, and 70 percent of the protein we consume comes from the sea: we are deeply dependent on the ocean.” ●●● We at Love146 are thankful for the tenacity of reporters like Ian Urbina who can give us a glimpse into the broader realities of exploitation and human trafficking.

This one about Lang Long in particular stood out to me: Lang’s ordeal be...gan in the back of a truck. After watching his younger siblings go hungry because their family’s rice patch in Cambodia couldn’t provide for everyone, he accepted a trafficker’s offer to travel across the Thai border for a construction job. It was his chance to start over. When he instead arrived at the sea port, the trafficker sold him to a boat captain for about $530, less than a water buffalo typically costs. Lang was kept for days by armed men in a room near the port. He was then herded with six other migrants up a gangway onto a shoddy wooden ship. It was the start of three brutal years in captivity at sea. “I cried,” said Lang, recounting how he was resold twice between fishing boats. After repeated escape attempts, one captain shackled him by the neck whenever other boats neared. Lang’s crews trawled primarily for forage fish, which are small and cheaply priced. Much of this catch comes from the waters off Thailand, where Lang was held, and is sold to the United States, typically for canned cat and dog food or feed for poultry, pigs, and farm-raised fish that Americans consume.” ●●● For more reporting on #TheOutlawOcean from @Ian_Urbina, visit the link in our bio this week.

But this weekend that’s exactly what federal agents did to hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein’s 21,000 square-foot Manhattan mansion. Today, federal prosecutors charged Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. The indictment is a big first step for justice for Epstein’s victims, who were not consulted by Florida prosecutors before the m...ulti-millionaire was given an exceptionally lenient plea agreement in 2008. Epstein was convicted in Florida only of soliciting a prostitute. He served 13 months in jail, was allowed to travel to and from his office, and he avoided prosecution for federal sex-trafficking offenses. For many reasons, proving trafficking is often a challenge for prosecutors. There are youth in our care we know were trafficked, yet their traffickers evade charges, or plea to lesser crimes. This is where people like you make a difference. In addition to the bravery of victims & sharp journalism from the Miami Herald, this case is moving forward because of public outcry. Til now, Epstein's case sent a message that people, especially powerful people, can do this without facing justice.

Imagine how you would feel if someone did that to a woman you cared about.” We couldn't agree more with Aqsa Sajjad on this, when she said: “This is probably one of the most common arguments against abuse and harassment. Men are often shamed into behaving themselves and treating women like human beings by being told that the girl they are thinking of disrespecting is someone els...e’s sister, mother, daughter or wife. The point is to make them think of how they would feel if someone disrespected their own sister, mother, daughter or wife. I’m sure everyone who advocates this argument has their heart in the right place. Their intention is to make the victim more relatable, but what they usually forget in the process is that women are people too, and their value does not lie in their relation to a man—or another woman, for that matter. But here’s a piece of shocking news: I am not someone’s property. I am not anyone’s sister. I am not anyone’s daughter. I am not anyone’s future wife. I do not want you to associate me with a man just to show someone else my worth. Don’t respect me because of my relation to a man, a relation to a man does not warrant me any respect...

Perpetrators in many of these headlines have hurt children in our care. When I see the headlines, I always ask myself, ""Where are the children?"" One of those children is Maya. When we say ""survivor"" we mean a lot of things. But one of the things we mean is that some don’t make it out alive. Maya made it out alive. About the man in one of these headlines above, Maya said: ""I ...hope he rots in jail. He will go to the devil. He will never do to other children what he did to us."" We are intentional about communicating hope, but sometimes I worry we don't tell you enough about what kids go through in order for you to fully celebrate with them. The stories we tell of hope and perseverance mean so much more when you know the kinds of trauma children have experienced. I noticed recently that at the root of the word ""persevere"" is the word ""severe."" Simply put, you can't truly celebrate perseverance unless you know the severity of what is being overcome. Know that whether the children in our care are climbing a ladder to our therapy treehouse or climbing the steps to the courthouse to confront their trafficker, whether they are experiencing struggle or triumph, you, our donors, are walking beside them. Today, Maya is a 5th grader. She struggles sometimes with the impact of what she's lived through. Still, she loves playing outside and doing ballet. She plays the guitar and dreams of becoming a famous singer. Maya can rock a sweat band and would knock you out in a game of badminton. Maya came into our care over six years ago, and steadfast people like you have been supporting her ever since. Two weeks ago we welcomed another child into our care and she needs you too.

Their suspects were arrested and today, the first suspect has been convicted!  A human trafficking and rape case was filed in 2018. The victims involved in this case, two females Nigam* (17)  and Shila* (15), were intercepted by our staff at Kakarvitta station, as they were crossing the border with two male suspects: Pramod* and Harka*.  During questioning, our team discovered the minor girls had been... raped multiple times by the two suspects. Pramod and Harka had been close friends since childhood. Nigam shared that she had been in a relationship with Pramod for several months. Meanwhile, Shila said that she and Harka were also in a relationship, and she told our team that he had asked her to marry him, even though she was underage and only 15 years old.  One day, Harka asked Shila to travel with him to Kathmandu for a job, and he suggested that she would be able to earn a lucrative salary there. Shila agreed and traveled with him to Kathmandu. Shortly after they arrived, Harka took Shila to a hotel, where he abused her before they eventually met up with Nigam and Pramod. The men convinced the two females to travel to Dharan with them in search of work. When they arrived in Dharan, Harka and Pramod took the two girls to an unidentified hotel room and abused them again. After that, they took them to the Kakarvitta border and prepared to cross over to India where they planned to stay in Pramod’s home. Our team helped the two females file cases against their suspects. Nigam’s case against Pramod is ongoing. However, in Shila’s case, the court has taken action against Harka, sentencing him to seven years in jail for rape and eight years for human trafficking. In total, Harka was sentenced to 15 years in jail and issued a hefty fine for his crimes.

Aftercare Director Jessica Mass was not expecting anything unusual to happen on her taxi ride to an aftercare home in South America. The taxi pulled up to the aftercare home, which was built to be very discreet. Right as Jessica pulled the door handle to exit, the taxi driver turned around and looked at her with tears in his eyes. “I grew up here,” he said. He began explaining his story. He was abandoned as a child and left to live on the streets. He was forced to take... drugs, which led to a cycle of addiction and theft at a very young age. When he was seven years old, Child Protective Services found him and took him to the aftercare home that Jessica was heading to. “If it wasn’t for this aftercare home, I would have stayed homeless, at high risk to being sexually exploited and addicted to drugs,” he said. “Instead, I am able to have a healthy, stable family.” Because of this very aftercare home, his life was changed forever. After he graduated from the aftercare home, he was able to attend a university for some time. This experience helped him learn how to run his own business as a taxi driver. Now over 40 years old, he has a family of his own with a wife and three beautiful children. “Not only did this home change my life, but it taught me how to be a good father, a good man, and how to protect women and children.” At the end of sharing his story, he had tears of gratitude streaming down his face. There is always hope, and this man is living proof of the positive difference that aftercare can make. O.U.R. was not around yet when this man was rescued off the streets, but this wonderful aftercare home was.

So many men and women travel legally or illegally to Thailand in search of jobs to support their families. Within these large groups of migrants, there are unidentified survivors of human trafficking who have been exploited and who need help and support.  Unfortunately, these men and women are often not identified as trafficking survivors and sli...p through the cracks. They return home broken and empty-handed, unaware there are resources available to help them, and are at high-risk for being re-exploited.   Our Ratanak staff are working with officials from the Ministry of Social Affairs of the Cambodian Government to ""Map out freedom"". We're partnering together to improve the methods of identifying men and women at the border who have experienced exploitation, ensuring that they can be safely reintegrated into their home communities with access to restorative services and long-term support.   In walking with Ratanak, you are helping to improve national systems that help protect trafficking survivors long-term. With your partnership, we can make sure that trafficking survivors who need help are no longer missed or forgotten.","2021-03-17T23:30:10","","https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-0/p235x350/160720133_3877306732383501_264438499853589157_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=nddvxvNGhSYAX_BjLmS&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=74b82170c2a9b0a193aa9a47767426ab&oe=607C6F35","https://www.facebook.com/ratanakinternational/photos/a.254158694698341/3877306729050168/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC102PURriEto8yF3qrb2c2eGVR40-Rh06I6a17Hqk67Pk8xUtorcr6QtTFCu-tdMi4lfhmKKJ4sEwIgDZaY4cWuhRKKX7MT5DT8OiRDQRyL0ebv6JE_cOD-l2Fn5LLkepnrTwHAGCc8ptQabQk4N0eSNZmQ9Nv1fWkxfzYVJEAXJUj6GDyJpL0wyKw6rsufz6EliJXlsxqaIHRN4wYPjeojpGcEXrGk_6gcwR8euwRg9LTvTyyMfA2dx60C3ZMSUa7BeUbiQ6d-yAsXQzwpkMHxzKX4nvP219AuPRLeW2C6Uv7IJFBYQ&__tn__=-R"

This groundbreaking campaign aims to provide vital information to protect refugees and asylum seekers who are travelling through Greece and Turkey from traffickers that they may encounter on the route or at the destination. #sttaman was aimed at young people seeking sanctuary in Greece who might be travelling alone and who are at higher risk of being targeted for exploitation.  To be able to reach young people travelling... from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan, the campaign was launched in four languages: Arabic, Bengali, Urdu and Farsi. The campaign also targeted refugees and asylum seekers through awareness-raising videos on Facebook and Instagram. The video illustrated the story of a young boy who was targeted and exploited by traffickers. Along with the video, extra resources were provided such as approaches to spot the signs of exploitation, how to stay safe and details for local contact organisations for support.  Geo-targeting via social media allows us to reach a wider audience than would otherwise be hard to reach, or reluctant to seek help, out of fear of consequences. As our first campaign draws to a close, our initial findings show we reached 71% of the target audience in Greece – that’s 27,208 young people. We have also learned that as a result of the campaign, many young people realised that they were experiencing exploitation and contacted the listed organisations for advice and support.  Thank you to all our fantastic partner organisations working on the ground, without whom this campaign would not have been possible.

While certain aspects of the fashion industry have evolved despite the pandemic, it’s important we don’t forget this doesn’t represent the story for all. Many garment workers continue to suffer as a direct result of Covid-19. The Guardian, publishing findings from the Office of National Statistics, revealed last week ...that garment workers in the UK have the highest rate of coronavirus deaths among working women. These findings come after multiple reports that garment workers in Leicester were forced to work throughout the first lockdown, as factories remained open without adequate safety measures in place. While many Leicester based factories made changes following the first lockdown, some allegedly continued to force machinists to work in close proximity without adequate safety measures in place.

Police in Latin America reached out to your national operatives for help in investigating suspected traffickers. This part of the country, that’s best known for its tourism, is also a place where kids are being sold for profit.   The traffickers had been recruiting children through school networks and social media and threatening them with extortion.  Travelers on holiday typically visit this area for just 3 to 4 days at a time. The challenge was deploying a team to go undercover with a believable cover story to stay and collect evidence for 2 full weeks.   But that’s exactly what your covert operatives did.  They put together a strong case, and authorities scheduled the raid. Local police were able to apprehend 3 traffickers from their own homes. Because of the location of the raid, no survivors were present. But, because of you, these traffickers will never be able to hurt children again. Thank you for equipping national operatives and local police in this strategic fight against child trafficking, and making this corner of Latin America a safer place for children.  *Names, image, and some details are representational.","2021-02-11T19:02:27","","https://scontent.fatl1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/146957622_3655175121227945_8640703557201275916_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=Z4bXEM6lYe8AX8g_pC-&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=3deb02e137c2603180361cb8cfec9d29&oe=607E18C2","https://www.facebook.com/TheExodusRoad/photos/a.398598390218984/3655175117894612/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBzVBi7Uz_kcOE4kHubCCsdlnL7BHtBRtiJoo2FfWm16lZ9evpUkb8mE8rY7-nh0L0AW9dOVmedjslHGolcg6_woxj_JzvowBmjS7ttHp1MU6tlX13v7Y476an8FG5DhvU-RiAX69EMtfS45nKg_SnfObRTBBpWxKMmAQBhZ5p6N6sA3aXinbG5am5RwxiYir9wqcnZQ3QOFPxAYC6bxEx2kMM_IKx7xjEmHd7jEgTx3yDy_FLPK0PTqeNjtigr0eZM1dn6HR4Wahs-uZozMMHiVEiMHVYOXpcDpwhw0BtM9oY7ZHaZXw&__tn__=-R"

Poverty and lack of opportunity made the promise of good jobs, the lure of stability, and a chance at more than mere survival seem worth any potential risks.  But your national operatives in India have been vigilant in their investigations. And they’ve been working to build a strong partnership with regional police leadership which is resulting in expeditious o...perations.  Within 17 days, they collected case evidence, and equipped police partners in organizing the raid and rescue.  And they found and freed Ela and Maira!  The women were immediately taken to a safe house to begin assessing their needs.  Their 5 traffickers were stopped and are now in jail.  Lives are being changed, and because of our strategic approach, the business of human trafficking is now even more uncertain in this region.

Akin “Damion” Martin, 28, found girls for his sex trafficking scheme online and then coerced them into prostitution at hotels throughout the city over a two-year period. After coercing the women, Martin stole their passports and other documents. He pocketed a total of more than $50,000 from the victims, often beating them if they refused to hand over money. In January, he threatened to shoot and kill a woman from the Bronx if she reported him to the NYPD.

Tomas is also the co-founder of the Greater Orlando Human Trafficking Task Force and has been a leader in the anti-Human Trafficking effort in Florida for over 15 years.  He’s worked tirelessly since 2009 at addressing the crimes “in our own backyard” by training first responders in our community - including law enforcement. For years he advocated to Orange County... that a shelter for adult females was desperately needed. Since its opening in January of 2018 the UA hotline has triaged hundreds of calls from the greater Orlando area with 65 percent of them being referred to that shelter.

Unfortunately, Kaya's trafficker did not allow her to attend school, so she only tests at a 2nd-grade level. Our dedicated education team will work w...ith Kaya to get her caught up, and get the educational support she needs to become a confident, star student!  We can already tell that Kaya is a fighter and we can already see that her resilient nature is going to carry her through the challenging seasons of healing she faces in the coming days.

Ellen traveled to China in 2012 with plans to work in a hair salon. However, when she arrived, traffickers forced Ellen onto the streets to sell her body. They demanded that she smuggle drugs in Macau in order to pay off a never-ending debt. Ellen endured a life of exploitation for over a year before she was arrested by Chinese authorities for overstaying her visa. She was imprisoned for six years and gave birth to her first child while incarcerated. And yet, from the darkness of a Chinese prison cell, Ellen held onto hope. After serving her sentence, Ellen returned home to Uganda and joined an aftercare program with Unseen Partner, Willow International. The aftercare program helped Ellen heal from years of trauma. Through the program, Ellen restored her independence and completed a vocational education in Interior Design and Decorating. Today, Ellen is the proud owner of a wedding decorating business and works as a part-time mentor to the girls in Willow’s aftercare homes. Her joy, her strength, and her commitment to fostering growth in others provide light to everyone she meets. Ellen has shared that she hopes to expand her business in the coming years. And of course, she will continue helping other survivors practice self-love and find peace in the knowledge that there are people out there fighting for those who have yet to be rescued. *Names and photos changed to protect Ellen's privacy. #antitrafficking #traffickingsurvivor #weareunseen","2021-03-17T23:00:12","","https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/161576530_4300242660003892_5922467461165384544_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=da1649&_nc_ohc=NRpDff5Lw4MAX9kNjnA&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=e31a4ff65780b73961f6c01f1fe781db&oe=607D96B1","https://www.facebook.com/WeAreUnseen/photos/a.362680353760162/4300242656670559/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCJAvc0pXzJgrYAPkmqLJ46ghGGmInn7lP8F7Eyum1EptxacERpyenDIBMvkM5ZD9msMHQNP3R4QkhAJXufq5WV-yasoAJDAV8oaYdTDNkOdam6s4_BRNkkpk6AJh_I1oeUGtjZUHA87K7SyIBnEJKd2zquzFDDlzEiVsczwfzMuz2WRoCbXRh_eeqe4VE9k3XimJxaZTunPGib_OXxEKTWyjOgXrlnptDC-_MlMN-FI8aecNw9IwrSMb5lopRxt9mXL2MDVGmrJQt3XNOg9RxqJIcGAo0SWdx50QmlrgTnA4lLUxrRlA&__tn__=-R"

Sex trafficking can look different in various areas of the world. From illicit massage parlors, to red light districts, to online sexual exploitation—they’re all forms of sex trafficking. It’s a lucrative business where exploiters earn up to 1000x profit from a single victim. Sex trafficking alone accounts for ⅔ (or $99 billion) of the total $150 billion human trafficking industr...y. In our upcoming newsletter, we’ll be breaking down more myths and facts about the industry, as well as highlight Unseen partners who work with survivors of sex trafficking. Our goal with our newsletter is to equip anti-trafficking advocates like you with helpful information, so we can all work together to #endhumantrafficking.

The recently released 2020 report is the fifth global report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). It draws on data from 148 countries, and explores issues such as the impact of the pandemic and traffickers’ use of the internet. “In order to act, we need to understand better the factors that facilitate human trafficking,” writes Ghada W...aly, Executive Director of the UNODC. “By bringing visibility to this crime, and shedding light on trafficking patterns and flows, this report can assist...in developing solutions capable of addressing root causes and risk factors.” She continues, saying, “We cannot allow the pandemic recession to reverse this progress or put more women, men and children in danger of being trafficked.” We’ll be breaking down information from this report in posts to come, as well as in our newsletter (sign up at weareunseen.org/get-email-updates).

Today, our #StoryofHope is about a child who fell victim to these circumstances—Asif. 12-year-old Asif dropped out of school a few weeks after India went into a nationwide lockdown. By April, his parents could only afford two meals a day and were getting desperate. When a person in their village offered Asif a job in Delhi with decent pay and suitable l...iving conditions, Asif’s parents agreed he should take the offer. So, Asif and four other boys made the day-long journey to Delhi. But when they arrived, the job was far from what was promised. The boys were put to work in a congested room for nearly 12 hours a day, cutting, stitching, and packaging leather gloves. They were not paid for their labor, and they were fed one meal a day. Asif was never allowed to leave the building, speak with his parents, or interact with outsiders. This continued until January 14, 2021. Unseen Partner, Justice Ventures International (JVI), along with their partner NGO, aided the local administration in a child labor rescue intervention.  Asif and four other minors were successfully removed from the facility, and the building was shut down. The employer is currently being prosecuted with the assistance of JVI lawyers. Asif was given medical care, and is now in a children’s home where he is receiving aftercare support. JVI and its partners in Bihar are working to establish contact with Asif’s parents to ensure they are reunited as a family once again.

"1037",4236848653009960,"Unseen",0,7,2,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,"What is happening in Myanmar? On Monday, thousands of Myanmarese—doctors, supermarket cashiers, bubble tea servers, civil workers—declared a general strike and poured into the streets. They held signs reading, “We don’t accept military coup” and “Respect our votes.” Many were seen lifting three fingers in the air—a symbol of solidarity and resistance against oppression (a symbol that has now been banned). Protests have been growing across Myanmar since February 1, when a mili...tary coup seized power from the elected government. Top elected leaders such as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, former State Counsellor and head of the National League for Democracy (NLD), were dragged off by soldiers and imprisoned. But, why? “The grievances which have been driving tension between the military and the government are well enough known,” said Jonathan Head, BBC’s South Asia Correspondent. “The military-backed party, the USDP, performed poorly in last November's general election, whereas the NLD did even better than in 2015.” The coup took place during the first week of parliament, which is no longer happening. Instead, nightly curfews are in place, international and domestic TV channels are off the air, and banks said they were forced to close. The United Nations, the United States, and the UK have condemned the military coup. Unseen partner, Fortify Rights, has people on the ground in Myanmar and is also calling for Myanmar to reverse the coup. “This violent crackdown must end now,” said Matthew Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Fortify Rights. “The people of Myanmar are exercising their rights, and the military junta should heed their calls and immediately reverse this coup.” Fortify Rights’ mission is to defend and ensure human rights for all.

An estimated 25 million people worldwide are victims of labor and sex trafficking, UNODC reports. As the pandemic continues to slow down support services and efforts to secure justice, concerns are growing that even more will be affected. Last month, the United Nations launched the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labor. Their goal is to end the practice of child labour by 2025—although urgent action is needed, they said, as the pandemic is threatening decades of progress.

Pornographic sites are just a click away, easy even for a child to access. Sex has become such an accessible, disposable product in the culture. Like fast food, it’s ready for you as soon as you crave it. Such disposable consumption makes us grow numb to true satisfaction. In the process of numbing our consciences to the sacredness of human life and sex, human tra...fficking begins to creep into our society. There are sex traffickers who dare to think that they are “helping” their victims by providing a job. There are even pedophiles who believe that they are “educating” children when they are horrifically abusing them. A person does not become a sex trafficker overnight. It is through the process of devaluing human life and the impact of sex that lead to exploitation of others for selfish gains. As long as society makes sex a convenient disposable product, vulnerable people and children will be objectified for exploitation and human trafficking will continue. We must emphasize the importance of teaching the youth about their true value and the psychological, physical, spiritual impact of sex. Because once boundaries are violated, it doesn’t stop. Sex is not a vending machine product that we purchase and dispose of on our way through life. It is God’s beautiful design, meant to be cherished, protected, and sacredly valued. This is an extremely important and urgent subject to teach, especially to young generations, to prevent them from becoming a victim or perpetrator. At ZOE Japan, we have the opportunity to share love and true satisfaction through Jesus Christ, shedding light that instant gratification will never fully satisfy our soul.  #humantrafficking #nonprofit #endit #childtrafficking #awareness #education #girlpower #stoptrafficking #advocacy #movingforward #selflove #justice #love #inspiring #changealife #nevergiveup #empowerothers #bethechange","2021-03-19T19:00:13","","https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/161786254_4123672584356150_6944829708808815949_o.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=rjn-7kq-XL0AX954Fcs&_nc_ht=scontent.fatl1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=2a5d143c140f8f14248f178d5823c802&oe=607DCA08","https://www.facebook.com/ZOEChildren/photos/a.374663999257046/4123672577689484/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD4rrhlrmZ-t7WS_3OSSfOfcbFQUcZvoi-vpiqZhNpNePxFj19JIduKie5D4yxQPnDAZeeI6rEqI9An8krW4IpRG8hMCPXDX2ygvcvubDWEbJSue3Peh_QasaEa_240hjbDb9u5l9E95ZRtiGo6H8hS94A5ekPbaDYOXw0uKx1hWALGt_mWGiUyEXW-YevYc_WHmv02Zb3FfYxBsGgKV7uv0P5YAfZLBJr6r1GDyrrry6XSXIUWzcNby7DJv_o4S1WJda7wLxxoeL2J22AR4FdDz4v3puWjikv6YAqBfoldijzUmtIX6A&__tn__=-R"

"1055",435789141022603,"ZOE International",5,6,0,0,0,2,0,0,8,0,"Japan is known for its hardworking culture. Fathers are often working excessively to provide for their family and live up to society’s expectations. There is even a term karoshi which means to literally work yourself to death.  This can lead to children often growing up without many opportunities to see or build close relationships with their fathers. Many young boys don’t have a role model to teach them to value and honor women. Instead, they might consume whatever the media... feeds them. Many young girls learn about life – and love – from friends, movies, or online. In addition, culturally, these topics are not openly discussed between parent and child. To fill the emotional void, children often turn to a popular networking app where they can interact with randomly selected strangers, ignorant of the danger of traffickers just waiting to take advantage of their vulnerability. What starts as a seemingly innocent online friendship soon leads to a face-to-face meeting with the trafficker during which the child is sexually abused. Photos and video footage taken during the abuse become key weapons that the trafficker uses to instill fear and force the child into further submission and continued abuse. Due to shame, fear, and not having a family dynamic where these types of concerns can openly be discussed, children find themselves alone and not knowing who to turn to for help. #endhumantrafficking #endit #zoe #zoeinternational #endslavery #advocacy #nonprofit #ministry #passion #compassion #life #love #outreach #losangeleslove #lanonprofit #localsupport","2021-03-05T20:00:31","https://www.facebook.com/ZOEChildren/videos/435789141022603","","https://www.facebook.com/ZOEChildren/videos/435789141022603/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARB5YysL0Tt-_pek7C50o0Ecq0quj5_7-q7jEeCBNalBOl6n2tOpnlxO1wQvucLhAvRIpbq_ptwx_cpC9s7kLDl0o6Jy9dNchzgHLpOC3QCXT6maSvUAQQ91s_wCADuGwAo1jSNHnhddHm3aQ56sBDJ2_ix2mRayuUUOcQQBSIb7qZYp6gJZ7CZvqiLymF_CMRuh-u0ki50odoZ8tTGM8bqQbD970IL7s7ywlOs4HsHIQdU93DeMKomuzi4vP46VJ0bTeZrFXmHUr0uXtvSDXy83TZ6sCZEKEuRPhToKH0M4pOaEfMRJNND8HBQBVF3Qdg&__tn__=-R"
